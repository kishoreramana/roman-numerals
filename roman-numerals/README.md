# roman-numerals
This project will convert the numerals into roman numerals

# Description

This application will convert an integer to a Roman number with following base line conditions of writing roman numerals:

The Romans wrote their numbers using letters; specifically the letters 'I' meaning '1', 'V' meaning '5', 'X' meaning '10', 'L' meaning '50', 'C' meaning '100', 'D' meaning '500', and 'M' meaning '1000'. There were certain rules that the numerals followed which should be observed.
The symbols 'I', 'X', 'C', and 'M' can be repeated at most 3 times in a row. 
The symbols 'V', 'L', and 'D' can never be repeated. 
The '1' symbols ('I', 'X', and 'C') can only be subtracted from the 2 next highest values ('IV' and 'IX', 'XL' and 'XC', 'CD' and 'CM').
Only one subtraction can be made per numeral ('XC' is allowed, 'XXC' is not).
The '5' symbols ('V', 'L', and 'D') can never be subtracted.
